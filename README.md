# Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Disease dataset

## Project Overview

### Objective:
The project aims to develop a predictive model and dashboard for identifying the risk of heart disease using the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. The goal is to analyze various medical attributes to predict the likelihood of heart disease, ultimately aiding in early detection and preventive healthcare.

### Data Sources:
The project utilizes the [UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), which contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, including patient information and various medical measurements.

### Key Metrics:
The analysis focuses on critical metrics such as age, sex, chest pain type, colored arteries (CA), thallium stress test results, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and maximum heart rate. The target variable is the diagnosis of heart disease, represented as a binary classification.

## Key Findings

1. Age and Heart Disease Risk: 
   There is a significant increase in the occurrence of heart disease in older patients, confirming that age is a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular conditions.
2. Gender Differences:
   The analysis reveals a higher prevalence of heart disease in male patients compared to females, suggesting gender as an important factor in heart disease risk assessment.
3. Asymptomatic Heart Disease:
   Most cases of heart disease are asymptomatic, as indicated by the relatively low correlation between chest pain (CP) and heart disease (correlation: 0.41). This suggests that many patients may not exhibit typical chest pain symptoms, making early detection more challenging.
4. Coronary Arteries and Heart Disease:
   The number of colored arteries (CA) is positively correlated with the occurrence of heart disease (correlation: 0.46). This highlights the importance of coronary artery analysis in predicting heart disease risk.
5. Thallium Stress Test:
   A significant correlation (correlation: 0.52) was found between heart disease and defect results in the thallium stress test, indicating that this test is a strong predictor of heart disease.
6. Exercise-Induced Angina and ST Depression:
   Exercise-induced angina (correlation: 0.43) and ST depression (correlation: 0.42) are strongly associated with heart disease, reinforcing the value of stress testing in cardiovascular assessment.
7. Low Correlation with Fasting Blood Sugar:
   Fasting blood sugar has a low correlation with heart disease (correlation: 0.025), suggesting that it may not be a significant predictor in this dataset.
8. Maximum Heart Rate:
   Maximum heart rate (Max HR) shows a negative correlation with heart disease (correlation: -0.42), indicating that patients with a lower maximum heart rate are more likely to have heart disease.

## Conclusions
1. Increased Risk in Older and Male Patients:
   The findings confirm that older patients and male patients are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. These demographics should be prioritized in preventive screenings and early interventions.
2. Asymptomatic Nature of Heart Disease:
   The low correlation between chest pain and heart disease highlights the challenge of diagnosing asymptomatic patients. Healthcare providers should not rely solely on chest pain as an indicator of heart disease and should use more comprehensive diagnostic tools.
3. Significance of Thallium Stress Tests and Coronary Arteries Analysis:
   The strong correlation of heart disease with defect thallium stress test results and the number of colored arteries underscores the importance of these diagnostic tools in predicting and managing heart disease.
4. Importance of Stress Testing:
   Exercise-induced angina and ST depression are key indicators of heart disease. Stress testing should be an integral part of cardiovascular risk assessments, especially for patients with suspected heart disease.
5. Limited Role of Fasting Blood Sugar:
   The low correlation of fasting blood sugar with heart disease suggests that it may not be a significant factor in this dataset. However, it remains an important metric for other health conditions.
   
## Recommendations
1. Prioritize Screening for High-Risk Groups:
   Regular cardiovascular screenings should be prioritized for older adults and male patients due to their higher risk of heart disease. These screenings should include comprehensive tests such as thallium stress tests and coronary artery analysis.
2. Utilize Comprehensive Diagnostic Tools:
   Given the asymptomatic nature of many heart disease cases, healthcare providers should use a combination of diagnostic tools beyond chest pain assessment, including stress tests and coronary artery evaluations.
3. Integrate Stress Testing in Routine Checks:
   Incorporate exercise-induced angina and ST depression tests into routine cardiovascular checks, particularly for patients with risk factors. These tests can provide early warning signs of potential heart disease.
4. Enhance Patient Education:
   Educate patients about the risks of heart disease even in the absence of symptoms like chest pain. Awareness campaigns can help in early detection and encourage patients to seek timely medical advice.
5. Focus on Comprehensive Risk Management:
   While fasting blood sugar may not be a significant predictor in this dataset, it remains crucial to manage overall cardiovascular risk through lifestyle changes, medication, and regular health check-ups.
