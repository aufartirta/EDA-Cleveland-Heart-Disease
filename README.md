# Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Disease dataset

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on the [Cleveland Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) dataset to examine factors related to heart disease.
The Cleveland dataset contains medical data on 303 patients who were treated for heart disease at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. </br>
Features include demographic information, vital signs, laboratory test results, and disease outcomes.
Initial data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
Summary statistics were calculated for all features including means, standard deviations, and value counts for categorical variables.
The target variable of heart disease was analyzed to determine prevalence in the dataset.
Visualizations including countplots, histograms, boxplots, and pairplots were created to understand feature distributions and relationships in the data.
Correlation analysis was performed to identify highly correlated predictor variables.

Follow-up analysis could apply machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease using key variables identified in this exploratory project.
